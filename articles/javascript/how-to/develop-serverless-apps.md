# Use Azure Functions to develop Node.js serverless code

Azure Functions provides serverless code infrastructure, allowing you to create responsive, on-demand HTTP endpoints. Serverless code is composed of JavaScript or TypeScript code that  runs in response to various events. 

Functions run on top of a web service, as code or a Docker container, which is abstracted away so you can focus on the code for your endpoint. Functions also allow you to trigger another function so that a function work stream can replace existing hosted backend server functionality and remove the need to manage that server.

## What is a Function resource?

An Azure Function resource is a logical unit for all related functions in a single Azure geographic location. The resource can contain a single function or many functions, which can be independent of each other or related with input or output triggers. You can select from many common functions or create your own.

The function resource settings include typical serverless configurations including environment variables, authentication, logging, and CORS.  

## Durable, stateful functions 

[Durable Functions](/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) retain *state*, or manage long-running functions in Azure. [Create your first durable function in JavaScript](/azure/azure-functions/durable/quickstart-js-vscode).

## Static web apps include functions 

When developing a static front-end client application (such as Angular, React, or Vue), which also need serverless APIs, use [Static Web apps](/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=react) with functions to bundle both together. 

### Proxy from client app to the API
If you intend to deploy your API with your Static web app, you do not need to use the npm `package.json` proxy property in your client application. The proxy will be established for you, including local and remote development.

If you intend to deploy your API separately from its client, you may need to set and use the npm `package.json` proxy property in your client application. The proxy would be required to develop locally between a running client (like a React app) and your Function API. When deploying both to hosting platforms, review the requirements of use service to understand how to accommodate your proxy needs.

## Common security settings you need to configure for your Azure Function

The following common settings should be configured to keep your Azure Function secure:

* Configuration settings
  * Configuration settings - create Application settings for settings that don't impact security. For any settings that impact security, create an [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/) and pull in those settings from your Key Vault.
  * Connection strings - store these in the **Connection strings** setting for your app. These values are encrypted at rest. 
  * FTP state on Platform settings - by default, all are allowed. You need to select **FTPS only** or disable FTP entirely to improve security. 
* API CORS - configure your client domains. Do not use `*`, indicating all domains. 
* TLS/SSL setting for HTTPS - by default, your API accepts HTTP and HTTPS requests. Enable **HTTPS only** in the **TLS/SSL settings**. Because your Function app is hosted on a secure subdomain, you can use it immediately (with `https`) and delay purchasing a domain name, and using a certificate for the domain until you are ready. 
* Deployment Slots - create a deployment slot, such as `stage` or `preflight` and push to that slot. Swap this stage slot to production when you are ready. Do not get in the habit of manually pushing to production. Your code base should be able to indicate the version or commit that is on a slot. 

## A simple JavaScript function for HTTP requests

A function is an exported asynchronous function with request and context information. The following partial screenshot from the Azure portal shows the function code. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/howto-serverless/portal-screenshot-azure-function-http.png" alt-text="Partial screenshot of Azure Function in Azure portal.":::

## Develop functions locally with Visual Studio Code and extensions

Create your [first function](/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code) using Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code, simplifies many of the details with the [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions).

This extension helps you create JavaScript and TypeScript functions with common templates. 

A JavaScript example of an HTTP function for Azure is: 

```nodejs
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

    const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
    const responseMessage = name
        ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
        : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";

    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: responseMessage
    };
}
```

A TypeScript example of an HTTP function for Azure is: 

```typescript
import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from "@azure/functions"

const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
    context.log('HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
    const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
    const responseMessage = name
        ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
        : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";

    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: responseMessage
    };

};

export default httpTrigger;
```

## Configuring the function

Functions are configured with the **function.json** file. This configuration allows you to configure how the function is triggered ("direction": in) and what the function returns ("direction": out). It also allows you to set environment variables, and other necessary information for the function to work. Learn more about the [trigger and binding](/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings?tabs=javascript.md). 

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Develop functions remotely using the Azure portal

When you [create an Azure function using the Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.FunctionApp), you can configure the function, write the code inside a pre-populated template, and test the function. 

The portal creates JavaScript functions only, not TypeScript. If you want to develop with TypeScript, either download the function or create the function locally in Visual Studio Code with the Function extension. 

## Low-code or high-code functions

Serverless functions remove much of the server configuration and management so you can focus on just the code you need. 

* Low-code functions: With Azure Functions, you can create functions that are triggered by other Azure services or that output to other Azure service using [trigger bindings](/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings). 
* High-code functions: For more control, use the Azure SDKs to coordinate and control other Azure services.

## Azure Cosmos DB integration

Azure Cosmos DB currently provides the following integration for functions:

|Type|API|Description|
|--|--|--|
|API & Binding|SQL|Connect to Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL via either [Bindings](/azure/azure-functions/functions-add-output-binding-cosmos-db-vs-code?tabs=in-process&pivots=programming-language-javascript) (low code) or [@azure/cosmos SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/cosmos).|
|API only|MongoDB|Use any MongoDB npm package with the Azure Cosmos DB connection string provided in the Azure portal for your resource. Common MongoDB packages include [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) and [MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb).|
