# Example: Provision Azure Storage using the Azure libraries for Python

In this article, you learn how to use the Azure management libraries in a Python script to provision a resource group that contains and Azure Storage account and a Blob storage container. ([Equivalent Azure CLI commands](#for-reference-equivalent-azure-cli-commands) are given later in this article. If you prefer to use the Azure portal, see [Create an Azure storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) and [Create a blob container](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal).)

After provisioning the resources, see [Example: Use Azure Storage](azure-sdk-example-storage-use.md) to use the Azure client libraries in Python application code to upload a file to the Blob storage container.

All the commands in this article work the same in Linux/macOS bash and Windows command shells unless noted.

## 1: Set up your local development environment

If you haven't already, **follow all the instructions** on [Configure your local Python dev environment for Azure](../../configure-local-development-environment.md).

Be sure to create a service principal for local development, and create and activate a virtual environment for this project.

## 2: Install the needed Azure library packages

1. Create a *requirements.txt* file that lists the management libraries used in this example:

    :::code language="txt" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/storage/requirements_provision.txt":::

1. In your terminal with the virtual environment activated, install the requirements:

    ```cmd
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 3: Write code to provision storage resources

This section describes how to provision storage resources from Python code. If you prefer, you can also provision resources through the Azure portal or through the [equivalent Azure CLI commands](#for-reference-equivalent-azure-cli-commands).

Create a Python file named *provision_blob.py* with the following code. The comments explain the details:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/storage/provision_blob.py":::

[!INCLUDE [cli-auth-note](../../includes/cli-auth-note.md)]

### Reference links for classes used in the code

- [AzureCliCredential (azure.identity)](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.azureclicredential)
- [ResourceManagementClient (azure.mgmt.resource)](/python/api/azure-mgmt-resource/azure.mgmt.resource.resourcemanagementclient)
- [StorageManagementClient (azure.mgmt.storage)](/python/api/azure-mgmt-storage/azure.mgmt.storage.storagemanagementclient)

## 4. Run the script

```cmd
python provision_blob.py
```

The script will take a minute or two to complete.

## 5: Verify the resources

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to verify that the resource group and storage account were provisioned as expected. You may need to wait a minute and also select **Show hidden types** in the resource group to see a storage account provisioned from a Python script:

    ![Azure portal page for the new resource group, showing the storage account](../../media/azure-sdk-example-storage/portal-show-hidden-types.png)

1. Select the storage account, then select **Data storage** > **Containers** in the left-hand menu to verify that the "blob-container-01" appears:

    ![Azure portal page for the storage account showing the blob container](../../media/azure-sdk-example-storage/portal-show-blob-containers.png)

1. If you want to try using these provisioned resources from application code, continue with [Example: Use Azure Storage](azure-sdk-example-storage-use.md).

For an additional example of using the Azure Storage management library, see the [Manage Python Storage sample](/samples/azure-samples/storage-python-manage/storage-python-manage/).

### For reference: equivalent Azure CLI commands

The following Azure CLI commands complete the same provisioning steps as the Python script:

# [cmd](#tab/cmd)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/storage/provision.cmd":::

# [bash](#tab/bash)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/storage/provision.sh":::

## 6: Clean up resources

Leave the resources in place if you want to follow the article [Example: Use Azure Storage](azure-sdk-example-storage-use.md) to use these resources in app code.

Otherwise, run the following command to avoid ongoing charges in your subscription.

```azurecli
az group delete -n PythonAzureExample-Storage-rg  --no-wait
```

[!INCLUDE [resource_group_begin_delete](../../includes/resource-group-begin-delete.md)]
