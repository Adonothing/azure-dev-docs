You can also use the [`ResourceManagementClient.resource_groups.begin_delete`](/python/api/azure-mgmt-resource/azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v2021_04_01.operations) method to delete a resource group from code. The code in [Example: Create a resource group](../sdk/examples/azure-sdk-example-resource-group.md) demonstrates usage.
