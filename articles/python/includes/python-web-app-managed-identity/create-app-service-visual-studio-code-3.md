When the creation process starts, you can view the progress in the **AZURE:ACTIVITY** window of the [Panels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) section of VS Code.
<br><br>
When the App Service is created, a notification comes up in lower right. The notification has options to deploy or view the output. We are not ready to deploy. If you go to the website, you'll see a default page because we haven't deployed anything. You'll deploy in a later step.
<br><br>
Select **View Output** to see a summary of the creation process in the **OUTPUT** panel.
