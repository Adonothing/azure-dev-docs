Once the database is created, configure access from your local environment to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL server by opening the Command Palette (**F1** or **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **P**).

1. Search for and select **PostgreSQL: Configure Firewall**.  (Select a subscription if prompted.)

1. Select the database you created above. If the database name doesn't appear in the list, it's likely it hasn't finished being created.

1. Select **Yes** in the dialog box to add your IP address to the firewall rules of the PostgreSQL server.
