After the firewall rule allowing local access has been successfully added, you can create the `restaurant` database.

1. In the **Azure** extension, find the PostgreSQL Server you created, right-click it, and select **Create Database**.

1. At the prompt, enter *restaurant* as the **Database Name**.

If you have trouble creating the database, the server may still be processing the firewall rule from the previous step. Wait a moment and try again.
