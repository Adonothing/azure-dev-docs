In the *.vscode* folder of the sample app, the *settings.json* file defines what happens when you use the Docker extension and select **Run** or **Run Interactive** from the context menu of a Tag.

The *settings.json* file contains two templates each for the `(MongoDB local)` and `(Mongo DB Azure)` scenarios.

* Replace both instances of `<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>` with your IP address.

* Replace both instances of `<CONNECTION_STRING>` with the connection string for your MongoDB database.

> [!NOTE]
> Both the database name and collection name are assumed to be `restaurants_reviews`.
