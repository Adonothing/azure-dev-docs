Start in the root of the sample app you cloned or downloaded.

**Step 1.** At a shell prompt, confirm that Docker is accessible.

```Docker
docker
```

If after running this command, you see help for the [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/), then continue. Otherwise, make sure Docker is installed or your shell has access to the Docker CLI.

**Step 2.** Build the image.

The general form of the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command is `docker build --rm --pull --file "<path-to-project-root>/Dockerfile" --label "com.microsoft.created-by=docker-cli" --tag "<container-name>:latest" "<path-to-project-root>"`.

For example, if you are at the root of the project directory, you can use the command like this to build an image:

#### [bash](#tab/terminal-bash)

```Docker
docker build --rm --pull \
  --file "Dockerfile" \
  --label "com.microsoft.create-by=docker-cli" \
  --tag "msdocspythoncontainerwebapp:latest" \
  .
```

#### [PowerShell terminal](#tab/terminal-powershell)

```Docker
docker build --rm --pull `
  --file "Dockerfile" `
  --label "com.microsoft.create-by=docker-cli" `
  --tag "msdocspythoncontainerwebapp:latest" `
  .
```

---

Note the dot (".") at the end of the command referring to the current directly in which the command runs. You can add `--no-cache` to force a rebuild.

**Step 3.** Confirm the image was built.

Use the [docker images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/) command to return a list of images.

```Docker
docker images
```

You should see images listed by REPOSITORY name, TAG, and CREATED date among other image characteristics.
