# AI services for Python apps on Azure

Azure Cognitive Services are cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services that help developers build cognitive intelligence into applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. There are ready-made AI services Cognitive Services for computer vision and image processing, language analysis and translation, speech, decision-making, search, and Azure OpenAI that you can use in your Python applications.

Because of the dynamic nature of Azure Cognitive Services, the best way to find getting started material for Python is to begin on the [Azure Cognitive Service hub page](/azure/cognitive-services/), and then find the specific service you're looking for.

1. On the hub page, select a service to go its documentation landing page. For example, for [Computer Vision](/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/).

1. On the landing page, select a category of the service. For example, in Computer Vision, select [Image Analysis](/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis).

1. In the documentation, look for **Quickstarts** in the table of contents. For example, in the Image Analysis documentation, there's a [Quickstart: Image Analysis](/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts-sdk/image-analysis-client-library-40).

1. In quickstart articles, choose the Python programming language if it exists or the REST API.

    If you don't see a quickstart, use the *filter by title* box, and search for *Python* to find Python-related articles.

Also, you can go to the [Azure Cognitive Services modules for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/cognitive-services) overview to learn about the available Python SDK modules.

The documentation for Azure Cognitive Search is in a separate part of the documentation:

- [Create an Azure Cognitive Search index in Python using Jupyter notebooks](/azure/search/search-get-started-python)
- [Use Python and AI to generate searchable content from Azure blobs](/azure/search/cognitive-search-tutorial-blob-python)
