## Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't have one, [get a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) or [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) 2.37.0 or above required. We recommend Azure Cloud Shell so you'll be logged in automatically and have access to all the tools you'll need.
- If you're using a Windows machine and want to run the samples locally, install and use the latest [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](/windows/wsl/install).
- MySQL command line client. You can connect to your server using a popular client tool, [mysql.exe](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) command-line tool with Azure Cloud Shell. Alternatively, you can use the MySQL command line in your local environment.
- A supported [Java Development Kit](../../fundamentals/java-support-on-azure.md), version 8 or above. (17 or above preferred. A JDK is included in Azure Cloud Shell). We recommend installing the [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](/java/openjdk/install).
- Apache's [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), version 3 or later.
- A [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) client.
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) or a similar HTTP utility to test functionality.
