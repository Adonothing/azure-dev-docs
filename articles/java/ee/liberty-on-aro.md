# Quickstart: Deploy IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift using the Azure portal

This article shows you how to quickly stand up IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

- A Red Hat account with complete profile. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free developer subscription through the [Red Hat Developer Subscription for Individuals](https://developers.redhat.com/register).

- Use [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) using the Bash environment; make sure the Azure CLI version is 2.43.0 or above.

   [![Launch Cloud Shell in a new window](../../includes/media/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com)

- Ensure the Azure identity you use to sign in has either the [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role and the [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) role or the [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) role in the current subscription. For an overview of Azure roles, see [What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)

- ARO requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. Ensure your subscription has sufficient quota.

## Get a Red Hat pull secret

The Azure Marketplace offer you're going to use in this article requires a Red Hat pull secret. This section shows you how to get a Red Hat pull secret for ARO. To learn about what a Red Hat pull secret is and why you need it, see [Get a Red Hat pull secret ](/azure/openshift/tutorial-create-cluster?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#get-a-red-hat-pull-secret-optional). To simply get the pull secret for use, continue to follow the steps in this section.

Use your Red Hat account to sign in to the OpenShift cluster manager portal, by visiting the [Red Hat OpenShift Hybrid Cloud Console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/azure/aro-provisioned). You may need to accept additional terms and update your account as shown here. Use the same password as when you created the account.

:::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/redhat-account-complete-profile.png" alt-text="Complete your Red Hat profile" lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/redhat-account-complete-profile.png":::

After you log in, select **OpenShit** then **Downloads**. Select the **All categories** dropdown and select **Tokens**. Under the **Pull secret**, select **Copy** or **Download** to get the value, as the following screenshot shows.

:::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/redhat-console-portal-pull-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Red Hat console portal showing the pull secret." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/redhat-console-portal-pull-secret.png":::

The following content is an example that was copied from Red Hat console portal, the auth codes are replaced with `xxxx...xxx`.

```json
{"auths":{"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"xxxx...xxx","email":"contoso-user@contoso.com"},"quay.io":{"auth":"xxx...xxx","email":"contoso-user@test.com"},"registry.connect.redhat.com":{"auth":"xxxx...xxx","email":"contoso-user@contoso.com"},"registry.redhat.io":{"auth":"xxxx...xxx","email":"contoso-user@contoso.com"}}}
```

Save the secret to a file, you'll use it later.

## Create an Azure AD Service Principal from Azure portal

The Azure Marketplace offer you're going to use in this article requires a service principal to deploy your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster. The offer assigns the service principal with proper privileges during deployment time, no role assignment needed. If you have a service principal ready to use, skip this section and move on to deploy the offer.

This section shows you how to deploy a service principal and get its Application (client) ID and secret from Azure portal. For more information, see [Create and use a service principal to deploy an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](/azure/openshift/howto-create-service-principal?pivots=aro-azureportal).

> [!NOTE]
> You must have sufficient permissions to register an application with your Azure AD tenant. See [Permissions required for registering an app](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#permissions-required-for-registering-an-app).

If you run into a problem, check the [required permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#permissions-required-for-registering-an-app) to make sure your account can create the identity.

- Sign in to your Azure Account through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
- Select **Azure Active Directory**.
- Select **App registrations**.
- Select **New registration**.
- Name the application, for example "liberty-on-aro-app". Select a supported account type, which determines who can use the application. After setting the values, select **Register**. It takes several seconds to provision the application. Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding.

    :::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-create-service-principal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing creating service principal." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-create-service-principal.png":::

- Save the Application (client) ID from the overview page. Hover the pointer over the value and select the copy icon that appears. The tooltip will say **Copy to clipboard**. Be careful to copy the correct value, since the other values in that section also have copy icons. Save the Application ID to a file, you'll use it later.

    :::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-obtain-service-principal-client-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing service principal client ID." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-obtain-service-principal-client-id.png":::

- Create a new client secret. 
  - Select **Certificates & secrets**.
  - Select **Client secrets**, then **New client secret**.
  - Provide a description of the secret, and a duration. When done, select **Add**.
  - After the client secret is added, the value of the client secret is displayed. Copy this value because you won't be able to retrieve it later. 

Now you've created your Azure AD application, service principal and client secret.

## Deploy IBM WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift

The steps in this section direct you to deploy IBM WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

The following steps show you how to find the offer and fill out the **Basics** blade.

1. In the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, enter *Liberty*. In the auto-suggested search results, in the **Marketplace** section, select **IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/marketplace-search-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift in search results." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/marketplace-search-results.png":::

:::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-liberty-on-aro-configure-cluster.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift ARO blade." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-liberty-on-aro-configure-cluster.png":::

1. Under **Create a new cluster**, select **Yes**.

1. Under **Provide information to create a new cluster**, for **Red Hat pull secret**, fill in the Red Hat pull secret that you obtained in [Get a Red Hat pull secret](#get-a-red-hat-pull-secret). Use the same value for **Confirm secret**.

1. Fill in **Service principal client ID** with your service principal Application (client) ID that you obtained in [Create an Azure AD Service Principal from Azure portal](#create-an-azure-ad-service-principal-from-azure-portal).

1. Fill in **Service principal client secret** with your service principal Application secret that you obtained in [Create an Azure AD Service Principal from Azure portal](#create-an-azure-ad-service-principal-from-azure-portal). Use the same value for **Confirm secret**.

The following steps show you how to fill out **Operator and application** blade and start the deployment.

:::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-liberty-on-aro-operator-and-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift Operator and application blade." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-liberty-on-aro-operator-and-application.png":::

1. Under **IBM supported?**, select **Yes**.

1. Leave the default option for the **Deploy an application?**.

1. Select **Review + create**. Ensure the green **Validation Passed** message appears at the top. If not, fix any validation problems and select **Review + create** again.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Track the progress of the deployment in the **Deployment is in progress** page.

Depending on network conditions and other activity in your selected region, the deployment may take up to 40 minutes to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> This quick start deploys IBM supported WebSphere Liberty Operator, you can also select **No** to deploy Open Liberty Operator. The quick start hasn't deployed an application either, you can select **Yes** for **Deploy an application?** to deploy an application.

## Verify the functionality of the deployment

The steps in this section show you how to verify the deployment has successfully completed.

If you navigated away from the **Deployment is in progress** page, the following steps will show you how to get back to that page. If you're still on the page that shows **Your deployment is complete**, you can skip to the step after the image below.

1. In the upper left of any portal page, select the hamburger menu and select **Resource groups**.

1. In the box with the text **Filter for any field**, enter the first few characters of the resource group you created previously. If you followed the recommended convention, enter your initials, then select the appropriate resource group.

1. In the left navigation blade, in the **Settings** section, select **Deployments**. You'll see an ordered list of the deployments to this resource group, with the most recent one first.

1. Scroll to the oldest entry in this list. This entry corresponds to the deployment you started in the preceding section. Select the oldest deployment, as shown here.

    :::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-liberty-on-aro-deployments.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift deployments." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-liberty-on-aro-deployments.png":::

1. In the left panel, select **Outputs**. This list shows the output values from the deployment. Useful information is included in the outputs.

1. Open Azure Cloud Shell, paste the value of **cmdToGetKubeadminCredentials**, you'll get the admin account and credential to log in OpenShit cluster console portal. The following content is an example of an admin account.

    ```bash
    user@Azure:~$ az aro list-credentials -g abc1228rg -n clusterf9e8b9
    {
      "kubeadminPassword": "xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx",
      "kubeadminUsername": "kubeadmin"
    }
    ```

1. Paste the value of **clusterConsoleUrl** in an Internet-connected web browser, and press **Enter**. Fill in the admin user name and password, you'll find the installed IBM WebSphere Liberty operator, as the following screenshot shows.

    :::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/redhat-openshit-cluster-console-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster console portal." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/redhat-openshit-cluster-console-portal.png":::

You're able to use the output commands to create an application or manage the cluster.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use the OpenShift cluster, navigate back to your working resource group. At the top of the page, under the text **Resource group**, select the resource group. Then, select **Delete resource group**.
