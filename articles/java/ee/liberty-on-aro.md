# Quickstart: Deploy IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift using the Azure portal

This article shows you how to quickly stand up IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

- Ensure the Azure identity you use to sign in has either the [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role or the [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) role in the current subscription. For an overview of Azure roles, see [What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)

- ARO requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. Ensure your subscription has sufficient quota.

## Get a Red Hat pull secret

The Azure Marketplace offer you're going to use in this article requires a Red Hat pull secret. This section shows you how to get a Red Hat pull secret for ARO. For more information, see [Get a Red Hat pull secret ](/azure/openshift/tutorial-create-cluster?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#get-a-red-hat-pull-secret-optional).

[Navigate to your Red Hat OpenShift cluster manager portal](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/azure/aro-provisioned) and log in. 

If you don't have a Red Hat account, you need to create a new Red Hat account with your business email and accept the terms and conditions.

After you log in, select **OpenShit**, **Downloads**. Scoll down to the button of the page, you will find **Tokens**. Under the **Pull secret**, select **copy** or **Download** to get the value, as the following screenshot shows. 

:::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/redhat-console-portal-pull-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Red Hat console portal showing the pull secret." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/redhat-console-portal-pull-secret.png":::

You can also log in https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret to navigate to the pull secret quickly.

The following content is an example that was copied from Red Hat console portal, the auth code are replaced with `xxxx...xxx`.

```json
{"auths":{"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"xxxx...xxx","email":"contoso@test.com"},"quay.io":{"auth":"xxx...xxx","email":"contoso@test.com"},"registry.connect.redhat.com":{"auth":"xxxx...xxx","email":"contoso@test.com"},"registry.redhat.io":{"auth":"xxxx...xxx","email":"contoso@test.com"}}}
```

Save the secret to a file, you will use it in the later section.

## Create an Azure AD Service Principal from Azure Portal

The Azure Marketplace offer you're going to use in this article requires a service principal to deploy your Azure Red Hat OpenShift clusters. The offer assigns the service principal with proper privilege during deployment time, no role assignment needed. If you have a service principal ready to use, skip this section and move on to deploy the offer.

This section shows you how to deploy a service principal and get its Application (client) ID and secret from Azure portal. For more information, see [Create and use a service principal to deploy an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](/azure/openshift/howto-create-service-principal?pivots=aro-azureportal).

> [!NOTE]
> You must have sufficient permissions to register an application with your Azure AD tenant. See [Permissions required for registering an app](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#permissions-required-for-registering-an-app).

If you run into a problem, check the [required permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#permissions-required-for-registering-an-app) to make sure your account can create the identity.

- Sign in to your Azure Account through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
- Select **Azure Active Directory**.
- Select **App registrations**.
- Select **New registration**.
- Name the application, for example "liberty-on-aro-app". Select a supported account type, which determines who can use the application. After setting the values, select **Register**. It takes several seconds to provision the application. Wait for the deployment completes before you move on.

- Obtain the Application (client) ID from the overview page, as the screenshot shows. Save the Application ID to a file, you will use it later.

    :::image type="content" source="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-obtain-service-principal-client-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal showing service principal client ID." lightbox="media/liberty-on-aro/azure-portal-obtain-service-principal-client-id.png":::

- Create a new application secret. 
  - Select **Certificates & secrets**.
  - Select **Client secrets** -> **New client secret**.
  - Provide a description of the secret, and a duration. When done, select **Add**.
  - After saving the client secret, the value of the client secret is displayed. Copy this value because you won't be able to retrieve the key later. 

You've created your Azure AD application, service principal and client secret.

## Deploy IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift

The steps in this section direct you to deploy IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

The following steps show you how to find the offer and fill out the **Basics** pane.
