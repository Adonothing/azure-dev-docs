#### Switch to a supported platform

Azure Spring Apps offers specific versions of Java and specific versions of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. To ensure compatibility, first migrate your application to one of the supported versions of Java in its current environment, then proceed with the remaining migration steps. Be sure to fully test the resulting configuration. Use the latest stable release of your Linux distribution in such tests.

For supported versions of Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud, as well instructions for updating, see [Prepare an application for deployment in Azure Spring Apps](/azure/spring-apps/how-to-prepare-app-deployment).
