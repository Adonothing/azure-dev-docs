### Validate that the supported Java version works correctly

JBoss EAP on Azure VMs requires a supported version of Java. For guidance on which version of the JDK to use, see [Supported Configurations](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.2/html/7.2.0_release_notes/supported_configs) in the Red Hat documentation.
